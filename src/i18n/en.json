    "q1": "What is KapKap?",
    "a1": "KapKap is the world’s first \"attention middle layer,\" connecting players, creators, and brands through AI, AIGC, and on-chain payment technologies to build a Web3 entertainment and creation ecosystem. Its core is to quantify every browse, interaction, creation, or share by users into tangible value, ultimately forming a self-sustaining, continuously expanding on-chain ecosystem.",
    "q2": "What can I do on KapKap?",
    "a2": "Players can accumulate attention and redeem rewards by using platform apps and engaging in interactions (e.g., browsing, liking, sharing), while enjoying personalized experiences. Creators can leverage AI tools to efficiently generate content, reach audiences precisely, monetize works easily, and build community influence. Brands can target audiences accurately via user profiles for effective marketing and content collaboration.",
    "q3": "How does attention convert into tangible value?",
    "a3": "Users’ attention behaviors (e.g., browsing duration, likes, comments, shares, payments) are quantified by the system using behavioral data and on-chain records, converted into transferable rewards (such as digital assets or benefits). These actions not only bring users real returns but also boost ecosystem activity, benefiting creators and brands.",
    "q4": "What specific roles do AI and AIGC play in KapKap?",
    "a4": "AI analyzes user interests, community relationships, and on-chain behaviors to generate multi-dimensional profiles, recommending the most relevant content to users and helping creators target audiences precisely. AIGC assists creators in quickly generating/iterating content, optimizing release strategies, reducing trial-and-error costs, and improving creation and promotion efficiency.",
    "q5": "What are the advantages of on-chain payments? How secure are they?",
    "a5": "On-chain payments support cross-chain and multi-chain, adapting to different users’ asset types. Earnings arrive in real-time with transparent, traceable records, avoiding intermediate interference. Backed by blockchain technology, transactions are fully encrypted and traceable, ensuring security and giving creators peace of mind when monetizing.",
    "q6": "Who is KapKap suitable for?",
    "a6": "It suits players seeking tangible value from daily interactions; creators aiming to create efficiently and monetize precisely; and brands/communities needing to reach target users and improve marketing efficiency. Every role finds matching value in the ecosystem.",
    "q7": "How does KapKap’s ecosystem operate cyclically?",
    "a7": "Players contribute attention and behavioral data to drive ecosystem activity; creators produce content based on these needs to gain earnings and influence; brands collaborate to meet user needs and drive content commercialization. The three form a closed loop with circulating, growing value, enabling the ecosystem to self-sustain.",
    "q8": "How to start using KapKap?",
    "a8": "If you’re a player, log in to access apps and games on the KapKap platform directly. If you’re a project party (e.g., creator or brand), submit an application, and we’ll contact you via email promptly."
